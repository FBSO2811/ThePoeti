NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

Pesami, è vero,<br>Che te perdo per sempre. Oimè per sempre<br>Parto da te. Mi si divide il core<br>In questo dir. Più non vedrò quegli occhi,<br>Nè la tua voce udrò! Dimmi: ma pria<br>Di lasciarmi in eterno, Elvira, un bacio<br>Non vorrai tu donarmi? un bacio solo<br>In tutto il viver mio? Grazia ch'ei chiegga<br>Non si nega a chi muor. Nè già vantarmi<br>Potrò del dono, io semispento, a cui<br>Straniera man le labbra oggi fra poco<br>Eternamente chiuderà. Ciò detto<br>Con un sospiro, all'adorata destra<br>Le fredde labbra supplicando affisse.<br>Stette sospesa e pensierosa in atto<br>La bellissima donna; e fiso il guardo,<br>Di mille vezzi sfavillante, in quello<br>Tenea dell'infelice, ove l'estrema<br>Lacrima rilucea. Nè dielle il core<br>Di sprezzar la dimanda, e il mesto addio<br>Rinacerbir col niego; anzi la vinse<br>Misericordia dei ben noti ardori.<br>E quel volto celeste, e quella bocca,<br>Già tanto desiata, e per molt'anni<br>Argomento di sogno e di sospiro,<br>Dolcemente appressando al volto afflitto<br>E scolorato dal mortale affanno,<br>Più baci e più, tutta benigna e in vista<br>D'alta pietà, su le convulse labbra<br>Del trepido, rapito amante impresse.<br>Che divenisti allor? quali appariro<br>Vita, morte, sventura agli occhi tuoi,<br>Fuggitivo Consalvo? Egli la mano,<br>Ch'ancor tenea, della diletta Elvira<br>Postasi al cor, che gli ultimi battea<br>Palpiti della morte e dell'amore,<br>Oh, disse, Elvira, Elvira mia! ben sono<br>In su la terra ancor; ben quelle labbra<br>Fur le tue labbra, e la tua mano io stringo!<br>Ahi vision d'estinto, o sogno, o cosa<br>Incredibil mi par. Deh quanto, Elvira,<br>Quanto debbo alla morte! Ascoso innanzi<br>Non ti fu l'amor mio per alcun tempo;<br>Non a te, non altrui; che non si cela<br>Vero amore alla terra. Assai palese<br>Agli atti, al volto sbigottito, agli occhi,<br>Ti fu: ma non ai detti. Ancora e sempre<br>Muto sarebbe l'infinito affetto<br>Che governa il cor mio, se non l'avesse<br>Fatto ardito il morir. Morrò contento<br>Del mio destino omai, nè più mi dolgo<br>Ch'aprii le luci al dì. Non vissi indarno,<br>Poscia che quella bocca alla mia bocca<br>Premer fu dato. Anzi felice estimo<br>La sorte mia. Due cose belle ha il mondo:<br>Amore e morte. All'una il ciel mi guida<br>In sul fior dell'età; nell'altro, assai<br>Fortunato mi tengo. Ah, se una volta,<br>Solo una volta il lungo amor quieto<br>E pago avessi tu, fora la terra<br>Fatta quindi per sempre un paradiso<br>Ai cangiati occhi miei. Fin la vecchiezza,<br>L'abborrita vecchiezza, avrei sofferto<br>Con riposato cor: che a sostentarla<br>Bastato sempre il rimembrar sarebbe<br>D'un solo istante, e il dir: felice io fui<br>Sovra tutti i felici. Ahi, ma cotanto<br>Esser beato non consente il cielo<br>A natura terrena. Amar tant'oltre<br>Non è dato con gioia. E ben per patto<br>In poter del carnefice ai flagelli,<br>Alle ruote, alle faci ito volando<br>Sarei dalle tue braccia; e ben disceso<br>Nel paventato sempiterno scempio.<br>O Elvira, Elvira, oh lui felice, oh sovra<br>Gl'immortali beato, a cui tu schiuda<br>Il sorriso d'amor! felice appresso<br>Chi per te sparga con la vita il sangue!<br>Lice, lice al mortal, non è già sogno<br>Come stimai gran tempo, ahi lice in terra<br>Provar felicità. Ciò seppi il giorno<br>Che fiso io ti mirai. Ben per mia morte<br>Questo m'accadde. E non però quel giorno<br>Con certo cor giammai, fra tante ambasce,<br>Quel fiero giorno biasimar sostenni.<br>Or tu vivi beata, e il mondo abbella,<br>Elvira mia, col tuo sembiante. Alcuno<br>Non l'amerà quant'io l'amai. Non nasce<br>Un altrettale amor. Quanto, deh quanto<br>Dal misero Consalvo in sì gran tempo<br>Chiamata fosti, e lamentata, e pianta!<br>Come al nome d'Elvira, in cor gelando.<br>Impallidir; come tremar son uso<br>All'amaro calcar della tua soglia,<br>A quella voce angelica, all'aspetto<br>Di quella fronte, io ch'al morir non tremo!<br>Ma la lena e la vita or vengon meno<br>Agli accenti d'amor. Passato è il tempo,<br>Nè questo dì rimemorar m'è dato.<br>Elvira, addio. Con la vital favilla<br>La tua diletta immagine si parte<br>Dal mio cor finalmente. Addio. Se grave<br>Non ti fu quest'affetto, al mio feretro<br>Dimani all'annottar manda un sospiro.<br>Tacque: nè molto andò, che a lui col suono<br>Mancò lo spirto; e innanzi sera il primo<br>Suo dì felice gli fuggia dal guardo.</pre>"], ["created_at", "2018-12-28 12:17:40.831751"], ["updated_at", "2018-12-28 12:17:40.831751"]]
